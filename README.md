## **Project Description:**


This project uses a deep learning model to apply artistic styles from one image onto another. It extracts content features from a photograph and style features from a painting, then combines them to generate a new image that preserves the original content while reflecting the chosen artistic style. The implementation is done in Python using PyTorch and runs in VS Code.
